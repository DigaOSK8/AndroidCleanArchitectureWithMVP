# AndroidCleanArchitectureWithMVP
Clean architecture in Android with MVP presentation layer.

The problem
-------
How to design a simple, decoupled, testable [clean architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) for Android, using [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) for the presentation layer.

The solution
-------
The solution is based on the [boilerpart code for asynchronous MVP design for Android, without 3rd party libraries](https://github.com/ovicon/AndroidAsynchronousMVPBoilerpart). 

Systems based on clean arhitecture have the following advantages: separation of concerns, independent of frameworks, independent of user interface, independent of databases, tetsable, multilayered.
